## Work experience

---

### Ph.D. student in Psychology/Computer science (incomplete)
**Université Paris-Saclay** - Bures-sur-Yvette, France  
09-2023 – 03-2025

Studied mathematical models of key features of consciousness, including information integration and emotional response. Focused on analysing how the geometry (e.g., Euclidean vs projective) of internal representation spaces impacts exploration behaviors.

**Research**:
- Co-author on ***Action of the Euclidean versus projective group on an agent’s internal space in curiosity driven exploration***, published in Biological Cybernetics | [Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00422-024-01001-1) - [Code](https://github.com/NilsRuet/effect-of-geometry-on-exploration)
- Poster presentation at ASSC27 - ***Exploring how the geometry of the representation space influences curiosity-based exploration*** | [Poster](/files/assc27_poster.pdf)
- Poster presentation at NeurIPS 2023 Infocog workshop - ***Influence of the geometry of the feature space on curiosity based exploration*** | [Poster](/files/neurips_poster.pdf)

**Teaching**:
- Teacher Assistant | Biomechanics, *Licence 1 STAPS* | Faculté des Sciences du Sport, Université-Paris-Saclay
